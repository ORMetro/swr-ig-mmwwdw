		<div>Total
garbage</div>
		<div>Food makes up nearly a fifth of the garbage generated by businesses and residents in greater Portland. As food decomposes in landfills, it creates gases that contribute to climate change. Removing food from garbage makes it easier to sort for recyclable materials, reduces what goes to landfills and makes it possible to convert food into compost or energy. Metro is working on ways to keep more food out of the garbage.</div>
		<div>Sort and recycle more</div>
		<div>Transfer stations already sort and salvage some garbage and construction debris. Metro is considering whether advanced sorting methods could be a viable way to expand what transfer stations pull out of garbage for reuse and recycling. More information will be provided as this discussion continues.</div>
		<div>About 50 miles south of Portland, Marion County converts 550 tons of garbage into electricity every day. Metro is exploring opportunities to convert a larger portion of the greater Portland’s garbage into energy.</div>
		<div>Metro’s transfer station in Oregon City handles garbage, yard trimmings, furniture and other bulky items and hazardous waste. But the facility has reached capacity, making it challenging to provide all of the services its customers need. Metro is considering two solutions: redesign the existing site or expand services to a second facility.</div>
		<div>A system of public and private transfer stations process greater Portland’s garbage and recycling for delivery to landfills and other destinations. Metro is exploring ways to manage this part of the garbage and recycling system to ensure more materials are recycled or reused, and to reduce the impacts of what the region throws away.</div>
		<div>Transfer Stations</div>
		<div>Most of the garbage created in greater Portland ends up in a landfill. While Metro will continue to focus on reducing the amount of garbage the region generates, landfills will continue to be a destination for at least some it. In choosing which landfills to use, Metro is considering which ones best protect the public’s health and the environment and get good value for the public’s money.</div>
