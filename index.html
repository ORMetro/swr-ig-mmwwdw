		<div>Food is the single largest portion of the garbage generated in the greater Portland area, and the primary source of methane in landfills, a potent source of climate change. Metro is looking at ways to keep more food out of the garbage, with policies that work for our residents, businesses and the environment.</div>

		<div>Metro manages the garbage and recycling system for more than 1.5 million people in Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties. We are exploring ways to reduce the amount of garbage produced in the region, encourage greater reuse and recycling, and manage landfills in a manner that is safe for people and the environment.</div>
		<div>GARBAGE IN GREATER PORTLAND</div>
		<div>Garbage and construction debris is sorted at transfer stations and reusable materials are sent to salvaging or recycling facilities. Metro is looking at advanced sorting methods to increase the region’s reuse and recycling rates.</div>

		<div>RENEWABLE RESOURCE
</div>
		<div>Garbage is a resource. In Oregon, 550 tons of garbage is turned into 13.1 megawatts of renewable electricity every day. Metro is exploring opportunities to convert a larger portion of the region’s garbage into energy.</div>
		<div>CHANGING NEEDS
</div>
		<div>Other Transfer Stations</div>
		<div>Metro licenses and regulates dozens of privately owned garbage and recycling facilities in the greater Portland area. Metro is invested in the future of these facilities, and is exploring ways to better manage the region’s garbage and recycling needs for the long-term.</div>
		<div>Metro’s solid waste transfer station in Oregon City handles garbage, food scraps, furniture and other bulky items and hazardous waste. But the facility has reached capacity, making it challenging to provide the full set of services that Metro South’s customers need. Metro is considering two options: redesign the site or open a new facility nearby.</div>
		<div>BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE

		<div>SEND LESS TO LANDFILLS</div>
		<div>Ninety percent of the garbage generated in the greater Portland area ends up in a landfill. Metro is currently developing a new long-term plan to guide where garbage goes and how we can better use it as a resource.</div>
